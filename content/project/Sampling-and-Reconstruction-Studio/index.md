title: Sampling-and-Reconstruction-Studio

summary: "Developing an illustrator for the signal recovery that shows Nyquist rate.
read csv signal and see the sampled points highlighted on top of the signal.
Change the sampling rate via a slider that range from 0 Hz to 3f max
Reconstruct/recover the signal from the sampled points.
Application has a Composer to generate basic signals to test and validate on the app
One graph to display the sinusoidal to be generated
One graph to display the sum of the generated sinusoidals.
A combobox to select one of the contributing sinusoidals and remove it via a delete button.
After making a synthetic signal then moving it to the main illustrator graph to start the sampling/recovery process"
