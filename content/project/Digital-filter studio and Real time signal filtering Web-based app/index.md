title: Digital-filter studio and Real time signal filtering Web-based app

summary: "The application leverages Z-transform concept to construct filters with
zeros and poles, capturing the phase and magnitude response then filters
real-time input signals and dynamically plots the results in real-time"

Implementation a website to design a custom digital filter via zeros-poles placement on the z-plane.
Modify the placed zeros/poles by dragging them.
Clicking on a zero or pole and delete it.
Clearing all zeros or clear all poles or clear all.
Has the option to add conjugates automatic.
A plot that shows the corresponding frequency response for the placed elements: One graph for the magnitude response and another graph for the phase response.
Apply the filter on a signal as if it is a real-time filtering process.
A graph shows the time progress of the signal.
Another graph to show the time progress of the filtered signal .
Control the speed of the filtering process (i.e the filter can process 1 point per second or 100 points per second or any number in between via a slider.
Correct for the phase by adding some All-Pass filters.
Picking the suitable all-pass through a library available in website to add to original filter
